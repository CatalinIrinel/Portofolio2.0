          I have a bachelor degree in Computer Science, I am a{' '}
          <span className="highlight">fullstack developer</span> with 5 years of
          experience. I have turned my passion into a full time job. I chose to
          work as a fullstack developer because this allows me to bring concepts
          to life from scratch. I improve myself through various courses and
          through the projects that I work on.
